# Webpage Code Refactor

## Description 

This project was made to help restructure a webpage so that it runs smoother and removes any unecessary elements.
I combed through the HTML and CSS to determine if there were any unecessary elements that could be removed or rearrange similar elements.
I learned that many elements that share the same function can be easily lumped together to reduce clutter and semantics are helpful in determining what is being displayed.
